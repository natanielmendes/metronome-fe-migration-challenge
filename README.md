# üß© Frontend Migration Take-Home Challenge

This repository contains a take-home coding challenge used by **Metronome Growth Systems** to evaluate **Senior Frontend Engineer** candidates.  

It simulates a realistic scenario: gradually migrating a **legacy AngularJS 1.x application** to **modern React + TypeScript**, while ensuring functionality, maintainability, and clean architecture.

We‚Äôre looking for engineers who combine **strong technical depth**, **clarity in communication**, and a genuine sense of **ownership**.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Candidate Workflow

1. **Clone or fork** this public repository to your own GitHub account.  
2. Complete both stages of the challenge as described below.  
3. Commit your work with meaningful messages ‚Äî we value readable history.  
4. When finished, make sure your repository is **public** so we can clone it.  
5. Email us or share the GitHub URL of your completed solution.

We will review your submission directly from your repository.

> üí° **Tip:** Keep your commits incremental ‚Äî they help us see how you think and structure your work.

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time Expectation

This challenge should take about **3 ‚Äì 3¬Ω hours total**:

- **Stage A ‚Äì Migration Strategy:** up to **90 minutes**  
- **Stage B ‚Äì Mini Prototype:** around **1¬Ω ‚Äì 2 hours**

We don‚Äôt expect a production-ready app ‚Äî **clarity, structure, and reasoning** matter most.

---

## üß† Stage A ‚Äì Migration Strategy (‚âà 60 ‚Äì 90 min)

Create a document called **`STRATEGY.md`** that explains *how* you would migrate a legacy AngularJS app to React incrementally.

You may use diagrams, bullet lists, or short paragraphs ‚Äî communicate as you would to teammates.

Please address:

1. **High-level approach** ‚Äì how would you break down the migration into safe, incremental steps?  
2. **Routing & co-existence** ‚Äì how would AngularJS and React live side-by-side during migration?  
3. **Shared state** ‚Äì how would global data (e.g., filters, session) flow between both worlds?  
4. **Styling isolation** ‚Äì how would you handle global CSS / Angular Material bleed-through?  
5. **Tech choices** ‚Äì which React libraries or patterns would you use and why?  
6. **Risks & rollout** ‚Äì what pitfalls do you foresee and how would you mitigate them?

> We‚Äôre interested in your **reasoning and trade-offs**, not a specific ‚Äúright‚Äù answer.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Stage B ‚Äì Mini Prototype (‚â§ 2 h)

Build a small demo that demonstrates your proposed approach.

- Keep **top + side menus** functional.  
- Implement one **legacy screen** (AngularJS or mock) and one **migrated React** screen.  
- Handle **shared state or data communication** between both worlds.  
- Use **TypeScript** and organize your code for clarity and maintainability.  
- Include a **`SOLUTION.md`** inside your solution with:
  - How to run the project  
  - Key architectural decisions (bullet points)  
  - What you‚Äôd improve with more time  
  - (Optional) where AI tools helped  

> You may restructure folders, introduce your own build tools, or use any approach that best demonstrates your migration strategy.

## üß≠ What We‚Äôll Be Evaluating

| Focus Area | What Good Looks Like |
|-------------|----------------------|
| **Code Quality & Structure** | Clean, readable, modular code; clear separation of concerns; idiomatic React + TypeScript |
| **Architecture & Reasoning** | Logical migration plan; clear boundaries between legacy ‚Üî modern layers; pragmatic trade-offs |
| **Communication & Documentation** | Concise, well-structured docs explaining decisions and why they were made |
| **React & JavaScript Ecosystem Knowledge** | Appropriate library / pattern choices; familiarity with modern tooling |
| **Execution & Pragmatism** | Runs easily; solves the problem within time limits; avoids unnecessary complexity |

> üí¨ We value **clarity, maintainability, and reasoning** far more than visual polish or completeness.

## üí° Tips

- Focus on **clarity over complexity** ‚Äî readable > clever.  
- Use **AI tools** if you wish; just note briefly where they helped.  
- Time-box yourself and explain what you‚Äôd do next if you had more time.  
- Show your **thought process** ‚Äî we care how you reason and communicate.

‚úÖ **That's it!**  
We appreciate the time you'll invest in this challenge and look forward to reviewing your approach.

## üìÅ README.md for each project

**Legacy App** (`/legacy-app`): The end of legacy-app/README.md now describes the three completed migration exercises: (1) a React counter widget embedded in the AngularJS Metrics screen with shared Redux store connectivity, (2) a complete React implementation of the Metrics screen as a new route (`/metrics-react`) showing full screen migration, and (3) style isolation techniques using CSS namespacing to prevent conflicts between Angular Material and React components. All exercises demonstrate real-time state synchronization across both frameworks.

**React App** (`/react-app`): The react-app/README.md specifies the React 18 + TypeScript application with Vite as the build tool. It documents the tech stack (Redux Toolkit for state management, React Router for routing, CSS Modules for styling), four feature screens (Overview, Metrics, Team, Settings), and the project structure showing clear separation between components, screens, store, and services layers.
