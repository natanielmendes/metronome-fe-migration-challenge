# 🧩 Frontend Migration Take-Home Challenge

This repository contains a take-home coding challenge used by **Metronome Growth Systems** to evaluate **Senior Frontend Engineer** candidates.  

It simulates a realistic scenario: gradually migrating a **legacy AngularJS 1.x application** to **modern React + TypeScript**, while ensuring functionality, maintainability, and clean architecture.

We’re looking for engineers who combine **strong technical depth**, **clarity in communication**, and a genuine sense of **ownership**.

## ⚙️ Candidate Workflow

1. **Clone or fork** this public repository to your own GitHub account.  
2. Complete both stages of the challenge as described below.  
3. Commit your work with meaningful messages — we value readable history.  
4. When finished, make sure your repository is **public** so we can clone it.  
5. Email us or share the GitHub URL of your completed solution.

We will review your submission directly from your repository.

> 💡 **Tip:** Keep your commits incremental — they help us see how you think and structure your work.

## ⏱️ Time Expectation

This challenge should take about **3 – 3½ hours total**:

- **Stage A – Migration Strategy:** up to **90 minutes**  
- **Stage B – Mini Prototype:** around **1½ – 2 hours**

We don’t expect a production-ready app — **clarity, structure, and reasoning** matter most.

---

## 🧠 Stage A – Migration Strategy (≈ 60 – 90 min)

Create a document called **`STRATEGY.md`** that explains *how* you would migrate a legacy AngularJS app to React incrementally.

You may use diagrams, bullet lists, or short paragraphs — communicate as you would to teammates.

Please address:

1. **High-level approach** – how would you break down the migration into safe, incremental steps?  
2. **Routing & co-existence** – how would AngularJS and React live side-by-side during migration?  
3. **Shared state** – how would global data (e.g., filters, session) flow between both worlds?  
4. **Styling isolation** – how would you handle global CSS / Angular Material bleed-through?  
5. **Tech choices** – which React libraries or patterns would you use and why?  
6. **Risks & rollout** – what pitfalls do you foresee and how would you mitigate them?

> We’re interested in your **reasoning and trade-offs**, not a specific “right” answer.

## ⚙️ Stage B – Mini Prototype (≤ 2 h)

Build a small demo that demonstrates your proposed approach.

- Keep **top + side menus** functional.  
- Implement one **legacy screen** (AngularJS or mock) and one **migrated React** screen.  
- Handle **shared state or data communication** between both worlds.  
- Use **TypeScript** and organize your code for clarity and maintainability.  
- Include a **`SOLUTION.md`** inside your solution with:
  - How to run the project  
  - Key architectural decisions (bullet points)  
  - What you’d improve with more time  
  - (Optional) where AI tools helped  

> You may restructure folders, introduce your own build tools, or use any approach that best demonstrates your migration strategy.

## 🧭 What We’ll Be Evaluating

| Focus Area | What Good Looks Like |
|-------------|----------------------|
| **Code Quality & Structure** | Clean, readable, modular code; clear separation of concerns; idiomatic React + TypeScript |
| **Architecture & Reasoning** | Logical migration plan; clear boundaries between legacy ↔ modern layers; pragmatic trade-offs |
| **Communication & Documentation** | Concise, well-structured docs explaining decisions and why they were made |
| **React & JavaScript Ecosystem Knowledge** | Appropriate library / pattern choices; familiarity with modern tooling |
| **Execution & Pragmatism** | Runs easily; solves the problem within time limits; avoids unnecessary complexity |

> 💬 We value **clarity, maintainability, and reasoning** far more than visual polish or completeness.

## 💡 Tips

- Focus on **clarity over complexity** — readable > clever.  
- Use **AI tools** if you wish; just note briefly where they helped.  
- Time-box yourself and explain what you’d do next if you had more time.  
- Show your **thought process** — we care how you reason and communicate.
