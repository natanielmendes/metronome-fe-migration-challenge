# Migration Strategy: AngularJS to React

## Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive strategy for migrating a legacy AngularJS 1.x application to modern React + TypeScript. The approach balances risk mitigation with developer velocity, enabling incremental migration while maintaining business continuity.

---

## 1. High-Level Approach: Incremental Migration Strategy

### Philosophy
- **Strangler Fig Pattern**: Gradually replace legacy features with React equivalents rather than a risky "big bang" rewrite
- **Feature-Based Migration**: Migrate complete features/screens at a time rather than splitting components
- **Maintain Dual-Runtime**: Both AngularJS and React coexist during migration, sharing state and navigation
- **Progressive Enhancement**: New features are built in React while legacy screens continue functioning

### Migration Phases

**Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)**
- Set up React build pipeline alongside AngularJS
- Establish shared state bridge (Redux ↔ ng-redux)
- Configure routing co-existence
- Create React component library with design system

**Phase 2: Pilot Migration (Weeks 3-4)**
- Migrate one simple, low-risk screen (e.g., Settings)
- Validate state sharing and navigation
- Implement toast notification system for user feedback
  - Display success messages (e.g., "Summary updated successfully", "Data reloaded")
  - Show error notifications for failed actions
  - Integrate library like `react-hot-toast` or `react-toastify`
- Establish patterns and best practices
- Document learnings and refine approach

**Phase 3: Core Feature Migration (Weeks 5-12)**
- Migrate remaining screens systematically
- Prioritize by complexity (simple → complex)
- Continuous testing and validation
- Monitor performance and user experience

**Phase 4: Legacy Removal (Weeks 13-14)**
- Remove AngularJS dependencies
- Clean up bridge code
- Optimize bundle size
- Final QA and performance tuning

## 2. Routing & Co-existence

### Dual-Router Strategy

Both AngularJS (`ui-router`) and React (`react-router`) run simultaneously with clear boundaries:

**Implementation Approach:**

```typescript
// React becomes the host application
// AngularJS screens are rendered within React routes

Route Structure:
├── React Router (Primary)
│   ├── /overview → React Component (migrated)
│   ├── /metrics → AngularJS Bridge Component (legacy)
│   ├── /team → React Component (migrated)
│   └── /settings → React Component (migrated)
```

**Technical Solution:**

1. **React as Host**: React Router controls all routing
2. **AngularJS Bridge Component**: A React component that bootstraps AngularJS for legacy screens
3. **URL Synchronization**: React Router updates trigger state updates visible to AngularJS

```tsx
// Example Bridge Component
const AngularJSBridge: React.FC<{ screen: string }> = ({ screen }) => {
  const containerRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    // Bootstrap AngularJS app in this container
    const angularModule = angular.bootstrap(containerRef.current, ['legacyApp']);
    
    return () => {
      // Cleanup on unmount
      angularModule.destroy();
    };
  }, []);
  
  return <div ref={containerRef} data-screen={screen} />;
};
```

**Benefits:**
- Clean URL structure maintained
- Back/forward navigation works seamlessly
- Progressive migration without breaking existing routes
- Easy rollback if issues occur

---

## 3. Shared State Management

### Challenge
AngularJS uses `ng-redux` while React uses Redux Toolkit. Both need to read/write the same global state.

### Solution: Single Redux Store with Dual Subscriptions

**Architecture:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         Single Redux Store              │
│  (workspace, navigation, status, etc.)  │
└─────────────────┬───────────────────────┘
                  │
         ┌────────┴────────┐
         │                 │
    ┌────▼────┐      ┌─────▼─────┐
    │ React   │      │ AngularJS │
    │ (hooks) │      │ (connect) │
    └─────────┘      └───────────┘
```

**Implementation:**

1. **Store Initialization**: Create Redux store before any framework initialization
2. **React Integration**: Use `react-redux` Provider and hooks
3. **AngularJS Integration**: Use `ng-redux` to connect to existing store

```javascript
// Shared store initialization (runs first)
const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    navigation: navigationReducer,
    workspace: workspaceReducer,
    status: statusReducer,
  },
});

// React connection (standard)
<Provider store={store}>
  <App />
</Provider>

// AngularJS connection
angular.module('legacyApp')
  .config(['$ngReduxProvider', ($ngReduxProvider) => {
    $ngReduxProvider.provideStore(store); // Use existing store!
  }]);
```

**State Update Flow:**
1. User action in React → dispatch action → Redux store updates
2. AngularJS components subscribed via `$ngRedux.connect()` receive updates
3. Same works in reverse (AngularJS → React)

**Critical Considerations:**
- **Serialization**: Keep state JSON-serializable (no functions, classes)
- **Immutability**: Both sides must follow Redux patterns
- **Action Namespacing**: Prevent action type collisions
- **Dev Tools**: Redux DevTools work for both frameworks

---

## 4. Styling Isolation

### Challenge
Angular Material global styles can bleed into React components and vice versa.

### Solutions

**4.1 CSS Modules for React**
- Scope styles locally per component
- Prevents class name collisions
- Enables side-by-side styling systems

```tsx
// Button.module.css
.button { /* scoped styles */ }

// Usage
import styles from './Button.module.css';
<button className={styles.button}>Click</button>
```

**4.2 CSS Namespacing**
```css
/* AngularJS styles */
.ng-app .md-button { /* legacy styles */ }

/* React styles */
.react-root .btn { /* modern styles */ }
```

**4.3 Shadow DOM (Advanced)**
- Encapsulate legacy AngularJS components in Shadow DOM
- Complete style isolation
- More complex but bulletproof

**4.4 CSS Reset for Migration Zone**
```css
.migration-boundary {
  all: initial; /* Reset all inherited styles */
}
```

**Recommended Approach:**
- Phase 1: CSS Modules + Namespacing (fastest, pragmatic)
- Phase 2: Gradually remove Angular Material as screens migrate
- Phase 3: Single design system (React only)

## 6. Risks & Mitigation Strategies

### Risk 1: State Synchronization Bugs
**Impact**: High - Data inconsistencies between AngularJS and React

**Mitigation:**
- Comprehensive integration tests for state bridge
- Redux DevTools monitoring in development
- Strict action typing (TypeScript)
- Feature flags to quickly disable problematic screens

### Risk 2: Performance Degradation
**Impact**: Medium - Running two frameworks increases bundle size

**Mitigation:**
- Code splitting (load AngularJS only when needed)
- Lazy load legacy screens
- Monitor bundle size in CI/CD
- Set performance budgets (< 300KB initial JS)
- Progressive migration reduces dual-framework time

### Risk 3: Routing Conflicts
**Impact**: High - Broken navigation breaks entire app

**Mitigation:**
- Comprehensive routing tests
- URL validation in CI/CD
- Staged rollout (internal → beta → production)
- Quick rollback strategy via feature flags

### Risk 4: Team Knowledge Gaps
**Impact**: Medium - Slower migration if team unfamiliar with React

**Mitigation:**
- Pair programming sessions
- Code review focus on patterns
- Internal documentation and examples
- "React Champion" designation for questions
- Weekly knowledge sharing sessions

### Risk 5: Styling Conflicts
**Impact**: Low-Medium - Visual bugs, poor UX

**Mitigation:**
- Visual regression testing (Percy, Chromatic)
- CSS specificity audit
- Strict naming conventions
- Dedicated QA pass for each migrated screen

### Risk 6: Scope Creep
**Impact**: High - Migration timeline extends indefinitely

**Mitigation:**
- Strict "like-for-like" initial migration
- Defer improvements to post-migration
- Regular progress reviews
- Clear definition of "done" for each screen
- Product owner alignment on priorities

---

## 7. Rollout Strategy

### Feature Flag Approach

Each migrated screen sits behind a feature flag:

```typescript
const useReactMetrics = featureFlags.get('react-metrics-screen');

// In router
{
  path: '/metrics',
  component: useReactMetrics ? ReactMetrics : AngularJSBridge
}
```

**Benefits:**
- A/B testing (compare old vs. new)
- Instant rollback without redeployment
- Gradual rollout by user segment
- Reduced risk

### Deployment Phases

**Phase 1: Internal (Week 1)**
- Enable for development team only
- Validate in production environment
- Fix critical bugs

**Phase 2: Beta (Week 2)**
- 10% of users via feature flag
- Monitor metrics (performance, errors)
- Gather user feedback

**Phase 3: Gradual Rollout (Weeks 3-4)**
- 25% → 50% → 75% → 100%
- Monitor error rates at each stage
- Pause if error rates spike

**Phase 4: Cleanup (Week 5+)**
- Remove feature flags
- Delete AngularJS code
- Bundle optimization

### Metrics to Monitor

- **Error Rates**: Track JS errors per screen
- **Performance**: Page load, Time to Interactive
- **User Engagement**: Click rates, task completion
- **Bundle Size**: Total JS size, delta per migration
- **Build Time**: CI/CD duration

### Rollback Criteria

Automatic rollback if:
- Error rate > 5% above baseline
- Performance degrades > 20%
- Critical user flows broken
